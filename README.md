# Tic-Tac-Toe

The [Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial on react.dev](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) suggests some extra excersizes to practice basic react skills:
> If you have extra time or want to practice your new React skills, here are some ideas for improvements that you could make to the tic-tac-toe game, listed in order of increasing difficulty:
> - For the current move only, show “You are at move #…” instead of a button.
> - Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
> - Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
> - When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win (and when no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw).
> - Display the location for each move in the format (row, col) in the move history list.

Done all that here except I've created the repo with vite (so styles are a bit different). And also I've added a slider to change the board size.
